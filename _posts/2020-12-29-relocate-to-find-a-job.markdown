Remote work is an incredible option to find a job anywhere and this year it’s trendy.
Unintentionally. The problem is that the competition for such jobs is huge. Pieter Levels thinks
[the odds of getting a remote job are less than 1%](https://levels.io/the-odds-of-getting-a-remote-job/)
.

On the other hand, there are still many companies preferring to hire people to the office, and wish
to go to the company’s location can be a candidate’s competitive advantage. Besides, relocation
looks like the only legal way of moving between countries now.

I work outside my homeland, and I am interested in the market of jobs with relocation, that is why I
am collecting them in my [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
channel: [https://t.me/relocateone](https://t.me/relocateone). I’m constantly extending the list of
sources.
