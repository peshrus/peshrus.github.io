Working with [GitHub](https://github.com/peshrus/) at [Crossover](https://medium.com/@peshrus/crossover-evaluation-4055c5ada695) I was glad to use
[Wide Github](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wide-github/kaalofacklcidaampbokdplbklpeldpj) plugin for Chrome. 

Now I work at [Epam](https://www.linkedin.com/company/epam-systems/) and I actively use [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). I missed that wide UI 
and tried to find something similar. I found [another CSS for GitHub](https://github.com/mdo/github-wide) and so decided to make my 
[own implementation](https://github.com/peshrus/gitlab-wide). The [existing ones](https://userstyles.org/styles/browse?search_terms=wide%20gitlab&type=false) 
didn't satisfy me because of unreasonably complicated CSS. I hope mine is better...
