Hi, I'm Ruslan Peshchuk, java software engineer, tech lead, people manager.

ðŸš€ My mission is to produce software helping customers to make their business ðŸ’¨ faster / ðŸ“ˆ better / ðŸ’° cost-effective.

My core values: 
 1. Transparency
 2. Responsibility
 3. Consistency
 4. Mutual trust
 5. Pithiness of communications

I work with Java and I can use any related libraries and tools to achieve goals set by your business. Read my [CV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sniRbbTAeSvsQOjrXtu2-uteTbu8GiI4i126yWmOUqc/edit?usp=sharing). 
If you are interested in my expertise, [send me an email](mailto:peshrus@gmail.com) or [text me in Telegram](https://t.me/peshrus).

I have some [travel blogging](http://russians-in-ireland.blogspot.com/) experience and [blogging about remote work](https://medium.com/@peshrus) 
experience, but this time I want to concentrate on technical topics and my thoughts regarding software development.

The source code of the site is on [GitHub](https://github.com/peshrus/peshrus.github.io). Suggest blog topics using 
[issues](https://github.com/peshrus/peshrus.github.io/issues) and do corrections using 
[pull requests](https://github.com/peshrus/peshrus.github.io/pulls). Thanks!
